    <p>I still remember the total feeling of panic, when I read the assignment. Write a multiple-choice quiz? They could have as well asked me to build a time machine or learn to fly. But JavaScript to the rescue, and line by line in vs code, the app began to come together. The final product is a multiple-choice quiz with timer and scores. It is built with JavaScript and Bootstrap.

   <p> Just when I felt so full of myself, having written the Quiz app, we began to learn Jquery. It felt like after I just began to “speak” vanilla JavaScript, the rules changed and there I was again staring at $signs, clueless. But just as coding can appear like an unsurmountable wall, it also, more than other fields that I studied, can be done in very small steps. Figuring out what variables needed to be declared, what elements grabbed, it suddenly made sense. The resulting app is a day planner with local storage, random quote API and Luxon for time and date.
