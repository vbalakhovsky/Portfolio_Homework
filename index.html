<p>I am a painter and I live in New York. Why am I learning to code? This is the question I have been asking myself for the past two weeks (sometimes with desperation in my voice). But despite the frequent puzzlement, I am coming to see the logic and the philosophy of coding that is not as removed from the work process of a painter as I thought.  I enjoy how, just like in painting, stepping away from the first intuitive choice sometimes reveals to me the connection between different elements of my work. </p>

   <p> On a less philosophical level, having worked in the creative visual field for quite some time now, I have noticed a certain chasm between the work of coding and creative teams. I am hoping that as a coding painter (or as a painting coder) I can discover a different, perhaps faster, and more synthetic way of how art can be realized in the digital universe. One particular area that interests me, is the aesthetics of children’s apps. Often the visual style of children’s digital content follows the cartoon tradition. If one were to look for children’s apps, they would see lots of primary colors, very little visual nuance and a kind of generic uniformity. It is, as if from the start, the developers have settled on a visual “kiddie menu.” So, as I am trying to write my first codes, I am slowly mapping in my mind a children’s literature app with thorough, interactive, and artistically meaningful illustrations.
